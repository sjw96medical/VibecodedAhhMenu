# 💬 Troubleshooting & FAQ

Click to expand each topic:

<details>

<summary><h2>❗ I'm having issues installing TenkaiMenu</h2></summary>

First of all, make sure you are running the most recent version of Among Us (`17.4` / ` 2026.6.5`) with **TenkaiMenu** (`v1.0.0`).

Also, check if your platform is officially supported:

- ✅ Steam
- ✅ Itch.io
- ✅ Epic Games Launcher
- ✅ Microsoft Store
- ✅ Xbox App
- ❔ Cracked (50/50)
- ❌ iOS App Store & Google Play
- ❌ PS & Switch & Xbox Console

Now ensure that you have downloaded the correct zip file for your platform:
- **For Steam or Itch.io:** Download `TenkaiMenu-v1.0.0-Steam-Itch.zip`
- **For Microsoft Store, Epic Games Store, or Xbox App:** Download `TenkaiMenu-v1.0.0-MicrosoftStore-EpicGames-XboxApp.zip`

Make sure you followed the installation guide precisely. This is what your `Among Us` folder should look like after a successful installation:

<br>Some antiviruses might cause issues when installing the mod, so consider temporarily deactivating your antivirus if the game isn't booting.

When installing TenkaiMenu for the first time, it will take **MUCH** longer than usual for the game to load. This is completely normal! You can keep track of the installation progress through the BepInEx console window that pops up when you start the game:

To let me know, you can open a new GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/fugodev/TenkaiMenu/issues/new), or you can discuss it with the community on our Discord server: [discord.gg/rJz747UQhG](https://discord.gg/rJz747UQhG). All contributions and ideas are welcome!

<summary><h2>👨‍💻 I want to contribute to this project</h2></summary>

To get started, I suggest you first learn the basics of C# and Unity, since that's what Among Us is written in. 

You should also learn about GitHub forking and pull requests, since you will need to use those to make any contributions to the project. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) is the official documentation on the topic.

In this project, I use BepInEx and Harmony to patch the game. I highly suggest taking a look at [this](https://docs.reactor.gg) great guide to learn how to work with those frameworks.

Here are some other useful resources:
- The [Reactor](https://reactor.gg/discord) Discord server (A great community of Among Us modders).
- [sus.wiki](https://github.com/roobscoob/among-us-protocol) (Useful resource to learn more about the Among Us network protocol, though slightly outdated).
